"We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert 
when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something
like "I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive..."  And
suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky 
was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and 
screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a
hundred miles an hour wiith the top down to Las Vegas.  And a
voice was screaming:  "Holy Jesus!  What are these goddamn 
animals?" - Hunter S. Thompson, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"

"Don't interrupt me while I'm interrupting." - Winston Churchill

"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what
we pretend to be." - Kurt Vonnegut Jr.  "Mother Night"

"Go to Heaven for the climate, Hell for the company." - Mark Twain

"I prefer someone who burns the flag and then wraps themselves up 
in the Constitution over someone who burns the Constitution and then 
wraps themselves up in the flag.” - Molly Ivins

and remove all doubt."  -- Abraham Lincoln
